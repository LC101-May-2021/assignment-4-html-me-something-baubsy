         <h2>Bojangles!</h2>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">We adopted Bojangles from a rescue in 2013 or 2014. He started out as a handful but has mellowed out. He can
            still be very moody and stubborn though! He love's twirling up in a blanket or finding a spot to squeeze
            into when he can. His name was supposed to be Finn but Bojnagles wound up sticking.</p>

         <h2>Peanut</h2>
         <p>Peanut is my sister's dog but I'm watching him for now. He arrived a year or two after Bojangles did. He's
            always hungry will try steal food if he thinks he can. </p>

         <h2>Both Together!</h2>
         <p>They used to love chasing each other around but have stopped. Peanut likes having space but Bojangles will
            lay right next to or even over him if Peanut is in the good spot. Bojangles will be very vocal if you leave
            Peanut outside on his own, he's stuck somewhere, or you take him somewhere. Peanut doesn't care where
            Bojange's is even if he is barking for help. They often wait on the steps for someone to come home.</p>
